Get back up to speed:
- Mermaid diagrams in each README
- Replace Locale with country+language



TODO:
	- Others
LoanApplication, add statuses like "denied" depending on credit check or manual inspection
Put MonetaryAmount.getAmount => BigDecimal in starter or library

	- Bugs
Norwegian customer with danish locale cannot create account because of IBAN creation error - still shows account in UI

	- Swagger, API, types:
Zod schema validation, or auto-generated types based on openapi spec? 
OpenAPI spec
	- Autogenerate controllers
	- Autogenerate webclients (Java)
	- Autogenerate webclients (Frontend?)
Better swagger examples (like possible response codes)
Swagger @Tag annotation for all controllers
Swagger examples for all request body parameters
Check that SpringDocs.replace in starter works
Request body validators
Proper response entities with http codes

	- Business logic:
If services don't respond, just ignore the data if possible instead of crashing with 500 internal server error
Input validation on recipient IBAN when making payment - trim and validate IBAN format?
Scheduled should be behind toggle, optional
Figure out how to handle currencies. Automatic conversion, pick from list, can only pick currency of receiving account...? 
Created/Updated timestamp in db by using r2dbc auditing

	- Documentation:
Each service should have sequence and component diagrams
Overall component diagram of all services

	- Ideas:
Make tests that prove that MonetaryAmount is encoded correctly by the baseWebClientBuilder
Some kind of Oauth? Or at least a fake login with govId + countryCode?
Continuous streaming of data, like a stock ticker, but more relevant?
Caching?
Consider setting up Actuator/Spring Boot statistics in Grafana, maybe with some custom Prometheus metrics
Store all requests in central Elastic with traceid, customerId, etc.
- It should be possible to search for customerId, traceId, service name, date/time
- Maybe as a starter?
Feature toggles

Payment-service
- Based on PSD2
- Has RabbitMQ listener for sign-callbacks

GovernmentRequestService
- Gathers information about accounts, customer information, etc. and returns it as XML

Credit worthiness assessment service
- Check the credit worthiness of a customer
- Use this to calculate how much money the customer can loan
- Very complex, so just assume we are calling external vendor, generate random data
- Stores information about loan limit and interest or similar - I don't know how this actually works
- Scheduled job that deletes data after 5 years

Fraud service
- Check if customer or loan application is fraudulent 
- Very complex, assume we are calling external vendor.
- Always return true
- If fraudulent activity detected, send message to GovernmentReportingTransferService

Loan application service
- Uses some external credit worthiness assessment service to find loan limit and interest (?)
- Checks fraud-service if fraudulent
- Show error page if credit worthiness not high enough or application fraudulent.

Frontend
- I18n, language selector?

Know-your-customer service
- Questions in one table, Answers in another
- Unique key on Answer table (QuestionId + CustomerId)
- Questions can have a "staleAfter" field that denotes when an answer to this question is no longer valid
- Answers should have createdDate, updatedDate
- Every time customer logs in, questions table is checked and if any mandatory question are unanswered, show KYC page
- Assume no complex/multilayered logic / flows for when questions are mandatory. Mandatoryness is always absolute and defined per question.
- If KYC service says that everything looks good, continue to profile
