# Alph Bank (Draft, goals)

A personal project to create a bank, including the following features and more:
* Core banking functionality
* Transaction history
* Payments to and from other customers using PSD2 inspired API (Payment baskets)
* Scheduled payments, recurring payments
* Simulated compliance-based nightly batch uploads to government entities
* Loan applications
* Simulated signing flow for authorizing payments and applying for loans, utilizing asynchronous callbacks when customer has signed
* Simulated credit worthiness checks for loan applications
* Simulated AML and fraud checks for payments and loan applications, triggering reports to government entities
* Know Your Customer (KYC) 
* Admin interface for manually processing and approving suspicious payments and loan applications
* Supports multiple languages, countries and currencies


Architecture:
* Backend written in Java, using Spring Webflux
* Reactive microservice architecture
* Client-facing REST API
* Frontend written in SvelteKit and Typescript
* Well-documented OpenAPI based API
* Largely asynchronous, using scheduled tasks and message queues
* Spring boot starters for common behavior
* Elasticsearch as a central location for logs generated by all services
* Integration tests with simulated external endpoints

What is not included:
* Proper authentication and authorization
* No proper deployment that can be tested. Local testing only
* Mostly intended to show backend skills and banking knowledge, so the front-end is quite barebones and does not use or provide good accessibility, best practices, nice user experiences across devices and browsers etc.
