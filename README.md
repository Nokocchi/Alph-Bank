# Alph Bank

If you feel like you don't quite have enough money, then just create your own bank!

This is a personal project, simulating an entire banking ecosystem, which is intended to showcase my knowledge and experience in Java backend development and Fintech. 

**NB:** *No intellectual property of current or previous employers has been used in this project.*

## Features

* Core banking functionality
* Payments to and from other customers using PSD2 inspired API (Payment baskets)
* Scheduled payments
* Recurring payments
* Simulated compliance-based nightly batch uploads to government entities
* Personal Loan applications with fixed-rate interest
* Simulated signing flow for authorizing payments and applying for loans, utilizing asynchronous callbacks when customer has signed
* Simulated credit worthiness checks for loan applications
* Simulated AML and fraud checks for payments and loan applications, triggering reports to government entities
* Know Your Customer (KYC) 
* Admin interface for manually processing and approving suspicious payments and loan applications
* Supports multiple languages, countries and currencies


## How to run

### Observability
* TODO: Elasticsearch as a central location for logs generated by all services?

### What is not included:
* Proper/safe authentication and authorization
* No proper deployment that can be tested. Local testing only
* Mostly intended to show backend skills and banking knowledge, so the front-end is quite barebones and does not use or provide good accessibility, best practices, nice user experiences across devices and browsers etc.
* Handling of concurrency and race conditions. These are real issues in enterprise software, especially once you implement concurrent requests and multiple replicas of the same service. There are many ways to solve this, depending on the situation. 
    * **Optimistic locking:** Only allow commits if the version number is correct, else roll back transaction. This works if multiple writes are done in a transaction.
    * **Pessimistic locking:** Get exclusive write-permission until your transaction has been committed.
    * **Write with filter**, and if affected rows is >0, continue business logic. If not, abort. This only works in special cases, like updating the enum status of a row.
    * ... And others. But I will leave these as an exercise for the reader :)
