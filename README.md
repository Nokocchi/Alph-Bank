# Alph Bank

If you feel like you don't quite have enough money, then just create your own bank!

This is a personal project, simulating an entire banking ecosystem, which is intended to showcase my knowledge and experience in Java backend development and Fintech. 

**NB:** *No intellectual property of current or previous employers has been used in this project.*

## Features

* [Core banking functionality](/banking-core)
* Payments to and from other customers using both [internal and PSD2](/payment-service/) inspired APIs
* Instant & scheduled single payments
* Recurring payments
* [Double entry bookkeeping of account transactions](/banking-core#double-entry-bookkeeping--account-transactions)
* Simulated compliance-based nightly batch uploads to government entities
* Personal Loan applications with fixed-rate interest
* [Simulated signing flow](/signing-service/) for authorizing payments and applying for loans, utilizing asynchronous callbacks when customer has signed
* Simulated Strong Customer Authentication via electronic identification (Simulated BankID flow)
* Simulated credit worthiness checks for loan applications
* Simulated AML and fraud checks for payments and loan applications, triggering reports to government entities
* Know Your Customer (KYC) 
* Admin interface for manually processing and approving suspicious payments and loan applications
* Supports multiple languages, countries and currencies

## Technical Overview

[Alph Bank Backend Technical Overview & Styleguide](/BackendStyleguide.md)

[Alph Bank Frontend Technical Overview & Styleguide](/FrontendStyleguide.md)

## Concepts I am aware of, but have decided not to implement:
* Proper/safe authentication and authorization
* No proper deployment that can be tested. Local testing only
* Mostly intended to show backend skills and banking knowledge, so the front-end is quite barebones and does not use or provide good accessibility, best practices, nice user experiences across devices and browsers etc.
* Handling of concurrency and race conditions.
* (Simulated) GDPR compliance
* Database audit logs / versioning of data
* Communication with other banks. We can assume that all transactions happen on accounts in Alph Bank
* Credit cards. 

## How to run
